<h3>What is Tutorbuddy?</h3>
<p>Tutorbuddy is a place for students to connect to their peer tutors. 
	Previously, honor societies used Google Forms, which required the officers to act as the mediators between tutors and tutees. 
	Tutorbuddy makes the entire tutoring system operate more efficiently, while at the same time tracking hours though the "handshake" system.</p>

<h3>How do I use Tutorbuddy?</h3>
<p>When you open up Tutorbuddy after signing in, you will see the dashboard. The dashboard is a place for several different things. First, it allows you to see your pending requests for other tutors, as well as other requests people have for you.
You will also see two buttons: one to sign up as a tutor, and one to find other tutors. This is where you go to request tutors and enroll as a tutor in all classes. The dashboard tab can be found in the top left of the screen, right next to the Tutorbuddy logo.
</p>
<p>
	Next, there is the "Buddies" tab. When you click on this tab, you will see two different columns: one column for your tutors and one for your tutees. You will notice that there may be buttons, saying "send handshake", "accept handshake", or "decline handshake".
	The Handshake function is the hour-tracking system. It is the responsibility of the tutor to "send a handshake" to their tutee after one hour of tutoring. The tutee must then verify this handshake by either accepting or denying the handshake. 
</p>
<p>
Beside the "Buddies" tab is a search bar. This bar basically just allows you to search for different students within the school and look at their profiles.
</p>
<p>
You will see three more tabs on the upper right side of the screen. The one with your name or username is a link to your personal profile. Next to that is the "update profile" tab - pretty self-explanatory. To the right of the "update profile" tab is the tab you can use to sign out.
</p>
<p>When you first sign up, I heavily encourage you to do two things: first, update your profile. Then, you should sign up to be a tutor in any class that you can. Remember, just because you can tutor in many classes does not mean that people will ask you to tutor in all of those classes.
This website was designed to prioritize those who have the least tutoring hours. Also, you can choose how many hours a week you can tutor by updating the "number of slots available" field.</p>

<p>This website was created by Alex Cuozzo with the help of Will Mundy. It is dedicated to the teacher who continues to inspire students to pursue their passions and accomplish great things: Ms. Goode.</p>
